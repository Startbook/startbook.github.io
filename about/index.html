        <p>
          Our products and services are helping entrepreneurship programmes to
          empower the next generation of founders. We're focusing on three areas
          right now:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Platform</b></li>
          <p>
            A digital platform to support entrepreneurship programmes with their
            operations and community management. Here are some of the things
            we're exploring right now:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tracking cohort programme attendance</li>

            <li>Creating digital pitch books for pitch days</li>

            <li>Community (cohort + alumni) management and overview</li>

            <li>Programme cohort status snapshots</li>

            <li>Incentivising programme feedback submission from cohort</li>

            <li>Pooling shared problems of cohort participants</li>

            <li>Mentor/participant matching</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We've already created an MVP collaboration platform as well as a
            solution for tracking programme/event attendance. We're currently
            working on an MVP that helps with running pitch days.
          </p>
          <li><b>Services</b></li>
          <p>
            Providing operational support and services to enterprise programmes.
            We're taking our learnings from this work to feed into our product
            roadmap to further support the organisations we work with.
          </p>
          <li><b>Community</b></li>
          <p>
            We're building a community of game-changing founders and partners.
            We're primarily focused on supporting diverse and solo founders. We
            don't need to explain diversity to you, but read below if you're
            interested in learning about why we're helping solo founders.
          </p>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <h2>Why solo founders?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>It’s hard being a solo founder.</p>

        <p>Most startups fail. Even more solo founder startups fail.</p>

        <p>It's no wonder why...</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Mental Health</b> - you are going on this journey alone and
            you're going against the grain
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Resources</b> - you have a fraction of the resources of the large
            majority founding teams
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Skills</b> - the set of available skills is limited to just those
            you have
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Ideation</b> - there is no co-founder to bounce ideas off of and
            help ideate
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Feedback</b> - there is no one going through the same process as
            you who can give you detailed feedback
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Decision making</b> - we're all human and we make mistakes, but
            you don't have anyone there to stop you making bad decisions
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>It's less fun</b> - there's no one to share the highs and the
            lows with, no one who truly understands and is there to cheer you up
            when things go wrong
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Accountability</b> - there is no co-founder relying on you and
            keeping you in check and on target
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Expensive</b> - you move slower and as a result end up paying
            extra to make up for your limitations
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Investment</b> - it's harder to get investor meetings and harder
            to convince them to invest
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We're tackling these problems with Founder Tribe.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Community</b></li>
          <p>
            Be nice. Relationships matter and collaboration is key. Give and get
            back to and from your fellow tribe members.
          </p>
          <li><b>Execution</b></li>
          <p>
            Ideas are worthless. What's important? Getting stuff done and
            figuring stuff out.
          </p>
          <li><b>Iteration</b></li>
          <p>
            Keep evolving your idea in response to customer feedback, not sure
            what to do? Speak to your customers.
          </p>
          <li><b>Vulnerability</b></li>
          <p>
            Awareness of your weaknesses is just as important as awareness of
            your strengths. Share your problems and weaknesses with others in a
            supportive environment.
          </p>
          <li><b>Diversity</b></li>
          <p>
            Different backgrounds, different ways of thinking, different
            networks; a strong tribe is a diverse tribe.
