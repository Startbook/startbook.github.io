# Startbook Platform Rebuild: Technical Brief

## Project Overview

**Startbook** is a comprehensive entrepreneurial ecosystem platform that connects founders, mentors, investors, coaches, and other stakeholders across 25+ events and programs. We're seeking an experienced software engineer to lead a complete platform rebuild using modern, scalable architecture from the ground up.

## Current Platform (Legacy System)

**Backend:** Deno/TypeScript with Oak framework, deployed on Google Cloud Run  
**Database:** 25+ separate Airtable bases (one per event/client)  
**Frontend:** React Native/Next.js (Solito) multi-platform application  
**File Storage:** Local filesystem on server instances  
**Authentication:** Custom email-based auth with generated tokens

The platform currently serves **10 distinct user types** (founders, mentors, investors, coaches, staff, guests, sponsors, perks, ventures, generic-guests) across a complex multi-tenant architecture where each event has its own Airtable base with event-specific field configurations.

## Target Architecture

We want to rebuild the platform using a **modern, cloud-native architecture**:

- **Vercel Serverless Functions** (Deno runtime) for backend APIs
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + real-time + auth + storage) as the unified database
- **Supabase Storage** for file handling with global CDN
- **Next.js 15** with App Router for enhanced frontend performance

## Key Development Challenges

### 1. **Multi-Tenant Architecture Design**

- Design unified PostgreSQL schema supporting flexible event contexts
- Implement event-based data isolation and custom field configurations
- Create flexible schema using JSONB for event-specific fields while maintaining type safety
- Ensure scalable tenant management and onboarding

### 2. **Complex Data Model Implementation**

- **Rebuild 50+ API endpoints** with enhanced functionality and performance
- **Dynamic field schemas** - each event can have different required/optional fields for each user type
- **Rich metadata system** defining field types, validation rules, and permissions
- **Cross-entity relationships** (founder-venture connections, contact forms, etc.)
- **Real-time data synchronisation** across all user types

### 3. **Modern Authentication & Authorisation**

- Implement Supabase Auth with email-based authentication
- Design event-scoped permissions and privacy controls
- Build comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC)
- Ensure seamless user experience across multiple events

### 4. **Advanced File Management**

- Design scalable file storage using Supabase Storage
- Handle avatars, logos, pitch decks, CVs across all user types
- Implement CDN integration with optimised delivery

## Scope of Work

### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture

- Design and implement complete Supabase database schema
- Set up Vercel project with modern serverless function architecture
- Configure Supabase Auth and authorisation patterns
- Establish development, staging, and production environments
- Create comprehensive data models and TypeScript definitions

### Phase 2: Core API Development

- Build 50+ API endpoints as Vercel serverless functions
- Implement real-time capabilities using Supabase subscriptions
- Create robust caching strategies and performance optimisations
- Develop comprehensive error handling and logging
- Build data validation and sanitisation layers

### Phase 3: Frontend Application

- Rebuild Next.js application
- Implement responsive design for all user types and workflows
- Create real-time UI components with Supabase integration
- Build comprehensive file upload/management interfaces
- Develop admin panels for event management

### Phase 4: Data Migration & Integration

- Build comprehensive migration scripts
- Implement data validation and integrity checks
- Create monitoring and rollback mechanisms
- Handle file migrations to Supabase Storage
- Validate data accuracy and completeness

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

- Comprehensive testing across all user types and events
- Performance benchmarking and optimisation
- Security testing and vulnerability assessment
- Production deployment with monitoring setup
- User acceptance testing and feedback integration
